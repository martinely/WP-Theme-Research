PROMPT — FIGMA (AI Agency Theme) — HOME 3 (AI Trainers / Consultants) — Desktop 1440

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for “AI Trainers / Consultants” focused on team enablement.
This is Home 3 of a 1-theme / 3-home system. Same design system as H1/H2, different section order & content.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-column grid, container 1200 centered, gutters 24. One frame only.
Style: premium education/consulting. Human-centered, credible, not “school LMS”. Elementor-friendly.

HERO (must feel training/consulting):
- H1: “AI training for teams” (or similar)
- Subhead: outcomes + hands-on format (bootcamps/workshops)
- CTAs: Primary “Request a training plan”, Secondary “View programs”
- Proof slot: corporate client logos OR learner metrics placeholders

SECTION ORDER:
1) Sticky header (nav: Programs, For Teams, Curriculum, Instructors, Resources, Contact + primary CTA)
2) Hero
3) Programs grid (3–4 cards: executive briefing, team bootcamp, role workshops, certification track optional)
4) Outcomes panel (3–5 metric placeholders; no numbers unless placeholders)
5) Curriculum modules (tabs/accordion; 4–6 modules: GenAI, Prompting, Agents, Automation workflows, Governance, Evaluation)
6) Role/industry tracks (selector grid; 6–8 roles)
7) Instructor bios (2–4 profiles; credentials placeholders)
8) Proof/testimonials (short corporate quote or mini case snippet)
9) Pricing logic section (default: “Request a quote” panel; optional tier cards as placeholders)
10) CTA band (Request plan)
11) Footer

COMPONENT RULES:
- Emphasize instructors + curriculum clarity.
- Avoid huge course catalog UI; keep it executive/consulting oriented.
- No invented certifications or outcomes; placeholders only.
Output: one polished high-fidelity UI frame, header-to-footer.
