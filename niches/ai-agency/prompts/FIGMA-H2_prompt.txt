PROMPT — FIGMA (AI Agency Theme) — HOME 2 (AI micro-SaaS product) — Desktop 1440

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI micro-SaaS product”.
This is Home 2 of a 1-theme / 3-home system. Same design system as H1/H3, but distinct layout & messaging.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-column grid, container 1200 centered, gutters 24. One frame only.
Style: modern SaaS, crisp, confident, light depth. Avoid gimmicks. Elementor-friendly.

HERO (must feel SaaS):
- H1: clear product category (e.g., “AI meeting notes, instantly”)
- Subhead: 1–2 lines benefit + privacy/trust microcopy (placeholders, no claims)
- CTAs: Primary “Start free”, Secondary “Request a demo”
- Right side: product UI screenshot placeholder (desktop app)
- Proof: ratings badges OR customer logo row (placeholders)

SECTION ORDER:
1) Sticky header (nav: Product, Solutions, Pricing, Resources; right: Start free + Sign in)
2) Hero
3) Feature stack (4–6 feature cards or stacked rows)
4) “How it works” mini row (3 steps, small)
5) Integrations logo strip (meeting tools + CRM placeholders) + link “See all integrations”
6) Trust/Security bar (badge placeholders: SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA only as placeholders)
7) Use-cases grid (6 persona/team cards)
8) Testimonials/ratings strip (short)
9) Pricing preview (2–4 plans, monthly/annual toggle visual; Enterprise = Contact sales)
10) Final CTA band (Start free)
11) Footer (include privacy/legal links)

COMPONENT RULES:
- Pricing table must be clean + readable (no giant comparison matrix).
- Keep sections compact; prioritize above-the-fold clarity.
- No invented stats or certifications; only placeholders.
Output: one polished high-fidelity UI frame, header-to-footer.
