PROMPT — INNER-02 (Offering Detail / Service Single / Product Single / Program Single) — AI Agency Theme (3 Homes) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme INNER PAGE template (desktop only) for a single offering detail page.
This is the shared “single” template that must support three modes:
- Mode A (Home 1): Service Single (AI automation / integration agency)
- Mode B (Home 2): Product Single (AI micro-SaaS product)
- Mode C (Home 3): Program Single (AI training / consulting)

CANVAS / GRID
- Desktop only: 1440w, 12-col grid, 1200px centered container, 24px gutters
- One frame only (no mobile)

BUILDER
- Elementor + Elementor Pro only
- Reusable sections + global styles
- No “magic” features; do not fake internal schedulers, analytics, or dashboards unless shown as static UI placeholders.

STYLE (shared system)
- Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm.
- Avoid generic AI clichés (robots, glowing brains).
- Card radius 16; large panels 20; subtle shadows; calm spacing.
- One design system shared across all homes.

HARD RULES
- Do NOT invent numbers, clients, case-study results, awards, or certifications.
- Placeholders allowed: “X+”, “From $X”, “X weeks”, “Since 20XX”.
- Do NOT claim SOC2/HIPAA/GDPR compliance unless explicitly provided by the user content. If needed, label as “Optional (if applicable)”.
- Primary CTA must be contextual:
  - Mode A: “Book a discovery call” (external scheduler modal embed preferred)
  - Mode B: “Start free” / “Try it” (links to sign-up)
  - Mode C: “Book a consultation” (external scheduler modal embed preferred)
