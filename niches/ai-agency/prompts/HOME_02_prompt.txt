PROMPT — HOME_02 (AI micro-SaaS) (Desktop 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI micro-SaaS products” brand.
Home 2 (secondary). Same global design system as Home 1 (header/footer/tokens), but distinct hero + section order.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only.
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only.

GOAL
Product-led clarity: show product suite, outcomes, integrations, and a strong “start” CTA.
No invented metrics. Use placeholders like “X+” only if needed.

STYLE
High-end, modern, friendly. Tech-forward but human.
Avoid generic AI imagery; prefer realistic product tiles, UI previews, subtle diagrams.

HEADER (shared system)
Logo left. Nav: Products, Use Cases, Integrations, Pricing, Docs, Blog, Contact.
Right CTA: “Try a product”.
