PROMPT — HOME_02 (AI micro-SaaS Products) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI micro-SaaS products” brand.
This is Home 2 (secondary). Same global design system as Home 1 (header/footer/tokens), but distinct hero + section order.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only.

GOAL
Product-led clarity: show product suite, outcomes, integrations, and start CTA.
No invented metrics. Use placeholders where needed.

HEADER (same as Home 1)
Nav can shift emphasis: Products, Use Cases, Integrations, Pricing, Docs, Blog, Contact

HERO (distinct for Home 2)
- H1: “Small AI tools that remove daily friction.”
- Subhead: “A suite of focused micro-SaaS products—meeting notes, workflow assistants, and automation add-ons that plug into your stack.”
- CTAs: Primary “Try a product” (scroll to products) + Secondary “See integrations”
- Visual: product tiles / dashboard previews (realistic, not generic)

SECTION: Product suite (highest priority)
3–6 product cards, each with:
- Name + 1-line promise
- “Best for” tags
- Key features bullets (3–5)
- CTA: “View product” (links to product page template)

SECTION: Use cases
8–10 chips grouped by team: Sales, Support, Ops, Recruiting, Founders

SECTION: Integrations
Logo grid + short text: “Connect in minutes.” (No false claims)

SECTION: How it works
Simple 3 steps: Connect → Configure → Run
Include “Data & privacy” link.

SECTION: Pricing
Simple monthly/annual toggle (visual only, no real prices required).
Tier cards: Free / Pro / Team (placeholders ok).

SECTION: Social proof
Testimonials + mini case snippets (no numbers).

SECTION: FAQ
Product concerns: setup, security, billing, export, cancellation.

SECTION: CTA
Banner: “Pick one tool or bundle the suite.”
Primary CTA: “Try a product”
