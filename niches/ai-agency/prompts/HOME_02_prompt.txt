PROMPT — HOME_02 (AI micro-SaaS Products) — Research → Blueprint + Copy (EN)

ROLE
Senior UX strategist + product marketing copywriter + WP theme IA (Elementor + Pro).

GOAL
Create Home 2 blueprint for showcasing AI micro-SaaS products (product-led). This homepage should sell software, highlight features, and convert to “Try / Sign up / Demo”, while staying theme-friendly.

INPUTS (WEIGHTED)
Primary (real products, HIGH weight): use ONLY niches/ai-agency/sources/HOME_02_URL_POOL.txt
Secondary (ThemeForest, MEDIUM weight): use ONLY niches/ai-agency/sources/TF_LINKS.txt
No other websites.

HARD RULES
- EN only. Facts only. Unknown/Inaccessible rules.
- Do NOT invent pricing, user counts, security certifications, performance claims.
- Evidence URLs max 12 total. No tables.

SCOPE
For each real product site:
- Open Home + at least 2 pages if available (Pricing, Product/Features, Use cases, Security/Trust, Integrations).
- Extract patterns that a theme can template (not bespoke engineering).

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
A) REAL-SITE PATTERNS (Home 2)
Group bullets by: Header/Nav, Hero, Demo media, Social proof, Core value props, Feature grid, Use cases, Integrations, Pricing preview, FAQ, Footer.
Each bullet: Pattern + note + Evidence URL.

B) HOME_02 BLUEPRINT (product-led structure)
- Section order + what changes vs Home 1
- CTA logic: primary “Try / Get started” + secondary “Request demo”
- Trust patterns: privacy/security section as “Design recommendation” unless explicitly present on sources
- Anchor IDs: #product #features #use-cases #integrations #pricing #faq

C) READY-TO-USE COPY (Home 2)
Write theme demo copy:
- H1 + subhead + 2 CTAs
- 6 feature cards
- 4 use-case tiles
- Integrations strip copy (generic)
- Pricing preview (no $ amounts; use plan names only)
- FAQ (6 Qs)
- Footer mini CTA

D) ELEMENTOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- CPT suggestion: Use Cases, Integrations (optional), Testimonials (optional)
- Reusable patterns: feature card, use-case tile, pricing card, FAQ accordion
- Keep content blocks short and modular.

IMPORTANT EMPHASIS FOR HOME_02
- Product clarity > agency credibility. Less “about us”, more “what it does”.
- Strong demo media pattern (video/animated UI) as placeholder.
- Onboarding expectations: sign-up flow, not salesy contact-first.
