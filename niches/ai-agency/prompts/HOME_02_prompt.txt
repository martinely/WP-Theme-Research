PROMPT — HOME_02 (AI micro-SaaS Products) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI micro-SaaS products” brand.
This is Home 2 (secondary). Use the SAME global design system as Home 1 (typography, spacing, buttons, card radii, header/footer), but a DISTINCT hero composition and section order.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Reusable sections + global styles. No “magic” fake product features.

GOAL
Product-led clarity: communicate what the suite is, who it’s for, how it plugs into existing tools, and drive to a trial.
No invented metrics. If a number is needed, use placeholders like “X+”, “XX%”, “#”. Avoid “best”, “revolutionary” without proof slots.

STYLE
Modern, high-end, product-forward. Confident, not corporate-bloated. Clean surfaces, generous whitespace.
Avoid cliché AI imagery (robots/brains). Use realistic UI tiles, subtle diagram lines, restrained gradient accents, and crisp iconography.
Use 1–2 signature motifs from the shared system (e.g., “workflow chips”, “integration connectors”, “micro-cards with subtle border glow”), but keep it tasteful.

HARD UX RULES
- Primary CTA: “Try for free” (routes to sign-up or pricing section). No fake checkout.
- Secondary CTA: “See integrations” (scroll to #integrations).
- Always provide a nearby trust slot: ratings/compliance/badges/logos/testimonials (placeholders ok, no fake claims).
- Keep scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, consistent card patterns.
