FIGMA-01 — AI Agency Theme (3 Homes) — Desktop only

You are designing a premium WordPress theme with ONE shared design system and THREE distinct homepages:
- Home 1: AI Automation / Integration Agency (primary)
- Home 2: AI micro-SaaS product
- Home 3: AI trainers / consultants

CANVAS
- Desktop only, 1440w
- 12-column grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24
- Create 3 separate frames: H1 / H2 / H3
- Use one consistent design system (type scale, spacing, radii, shadows, buttons, forms)

STYLE (premium, not template)
- Modern, confident, high-end, minimal but with character
- Strong typography hierarchy, generous whitespace
- Rounded cards (16) and panels (20), subtle shadows
- Avoid generic “AI clipart”. Use abstract/technical patterns, tasteful gradients, real-world photos only if needed
- Accessibility: clear contrast, focus states, readable body text

GLOBAL RULES (shared system, different content)
- 1 primary CTA + 1 secondary CTA max per home
- Every strong claim must have a nearby proof slot (logos / metrics / badges / testimonial)
- Keep nav simple (no mega menus). Support 1 level dropdown max
- Footer: clean legal + links + social, no enterprise portal complexity

- Hero (variant per home)
- Card grid system (services/features/programs)
- Proof/Trust strip (3 content modes)
