PROMPT — FIGMA (AI Agency) — HOME 1 (Automation / Integration Agency) — Desktop 1440

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI Automation / Integration Agency”.
This is Home 1 (primary) of a 1-theme / 3-home system (H1 agency, H2 micro-SaaS, H3 trainers).
Canvas: 1440w, 12-column grid, container 1200 centered, gutters 24. One frame only.
Style: high-end, modern, technical-but-warm. Clean whitespace. Subtle gradients/noise, crisp type. Avoid cliché “AI brain” imagery.
Builder reality: Elementor-friendly sections/cards; no fake dynamic features.

HERO (must feel agency): 
- Eyebrow: “AI Automation & Integration”
- H1: outcome-led promise (no numbers)
- Subhead: strategy → build → integrate → optimize (1–2 lines)
- CTAs: Primary “Book a discovery call”, Secondary “Explore capabilities”
- Add proof slot: client logo strip OR 3 proof chips (placeholders)

SECTION ORDER (top → bottom):
1) Sticky header (logo + nav: Services, Case Studies, About, Resources, Contact + primary CTA)
2) Hero (as above)
3) Capabilities grid (4–6 cards; each: title + 1 sentence + link)
4) Proof strip (logos OR outcome chips placeholders)
5) Methodology stepper (4–6 steps: Discover → Design → Build → Integrate → Train → Support)
6) Case studies teaser (2–3 cards: industry, problem/solution/outcome lines)
7) Industries / use-cases mini grid (optional; chips/cards)
8) Testimonials (2–3 short quotes)
9) CTA band (book)
10) Footer

COMPONENT RULES:
- Cards: radius 16; panels 20; very soft shadows.
- Keep copy short and scannable.
- Use credible enterprise-style photo/video placeholders (workshops, teams, operations) or abstract tech textures.
- Include small “trust microcopy” under CTAs (placeholders only, no claims).
Output: one polished high-fidelity UI frame, header-to-footer.
