PROMPT — HOME_01 (AI Automation / Integration Agency) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI Automation / Integration Agency”.
This is Home 1 (primary). Goal: conversion-first, trust-first, enterprise-friendly but not corporate-bloated.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder assumption: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Use reusable sections + global styles. No “magic” features.

STYLE
- Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
- One design system shared across all 3 homes: consistent header/footer, typography, buttons, card radii, spacing.
- Distinct hero composition + 1–2 signature motifs (workflow chips, subtle diagram lines, restrained gradient accents).
- Avoid generic AI clichés (robots, glowing brains). Prefer abstract systems, real teams, dashboards, integrations.

HARD UX RULES
- No fake metrics. No invented numbers/clients/awards. Use placeholders like “X+”, “Timeline: X–Y weeks”.
- Primary CTA label must be “Book a discovery call” and route to external scheduler (modal embed preferred).
- Secondary CTA: “View automation examples” (scroll to #use-cases).
- Keep scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, strong hierarchy.

HEADER (sticky)
- Left: logo
- Nav: Services, Use Cases, Process, Industries, Proof, Pricing, Resources, Contact
- Right: Primary CTA button “Book a discovery call”
- Utility link: “Security & compliance” (can be footer too)

SECTION ORDER (LOCKED)
1) Hero
2) Trusted by / logos (optional)

5) #process How we work
6) Industries

HERO (distinct for Home 1)
- H1: “Automate work. Integrate systems. Ship faster.”
- Subhead: “We design and deploy AI + workflow automations across your tools—reliably, securely, and with measurable outcomes.”
- Proof chips: “Zapier / Make / n8n”, “OpenAI / Anthropic”, “HubSpot / Salesforce”, “Slack / Google Workspace”
- CTAs: Primary “Book a discovery call” + Secondary “View automation examples”
- Micro trust line (optional): “Built for production, not demos.”
- Visual: abstract workflow diagram / integration map (minimal, tasteful)

SECTION: Trusted by / logos (optional)
- Row of logo placeholders + caption “Teams choose us for reliable delivery”

SECTION #use-cases: Automation examples
Show 6 cards. Each card format:
Title + tags + three mini rows:
- Inputs:
- Automates:
- Result: (no numbers)

Use these 6 examples (exact text):

Inputs: web forms, email, CRM
Automates: enrichment, dedupe, assignment, alerts
Result: faster follow-up, cleaner pipeline

2) Support triage → summarization → ticket creation
Inputs: inbox, chat, helpdesk
Automates: summarise, classify, create ticket, escalate
Result: quicker response, consistent triage

3) Finance ops → invoice matching → alerts
Inputs: invoices, PO data, accounting tool
Automates: match, flag exceptions, notify approver
Result: fewer exceptions missed

4) Sales calls → notes → follow-ups → tasks
Inputs: meeting recordings, CRM
Automates: notes, action items, CRM updates
Result: better follow-through

5) Recruiting → screening → scheduling
Inputs: applications, calendar
Automates: screen, shortlist, schedule, reminders
Result: less admin overhead

6) Knowledge base → Q&A bot → escalation
Inputs: docs, wiki, tickets
Automates: answer drafts, cite sources, escalate when needed
Result: faster internal answers
