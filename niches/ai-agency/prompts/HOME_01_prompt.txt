PROMPT — HOME_01 (AI Automation / Integration Agency) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI Automation / Integration Agency”.
This is Home 1 (primary). Goal: conversion-first, trust-first, enterprise-friendly but not corporate-bloated.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder assumption: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Use reusable sections + global styles. No “magic” product features.

STYLE
- Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
- One design system shared across all 3 homes: consistent header/footer, typography scale, buttons, card radii, spacing.
- Distinctiveness: unique hero composition + 1–2 signature UI motifs (e.g., “workflow chips”, subtle diagram lines, restrained gradient accents).
- Avoid generic AI clichés (robot heads, glowing brains). Prefer abstract systems, real teams, dashboards, integrations.

HARD UX RULES
- No fake metrics. No invented numbers. If a number is needed, use placeholders like “X+”.
- Primary CTA must be “Book a discovery call” and must route to external scheduling embed/link pattern (modal embed preferred).
- Secondary CTA: “View automation examples” (scroll to #use-cases).
- Keep page scannable: short paragraphs, bullet lists, clear modules, strong hierarchy.

HEADER (sticky)
- Left: logo
- Nav: Services, Use Cases, Process, Industries, Proof, Pricing, Resources, Contact
- Right: Primary CTA button “Book a discovery call”
- Small utility link: “Security & compliance” (can be footer too)

HERO (distinct for Home 1)
- H1: “Automate work. Integrate systems. Ship faster.”
- Subhead: “We design and deploy AI + workflow automations across your tools—reliably, securely, and with measurable outcomes.”
- Proof chips (no numbers): “Zapier / Make / n8n”, “OpenAI / Anthropic”, “HubSpot / Salesforce”, “Slack / Google Workspace”
- CTAs: Primary “Book a discovery call” + Secondary “View automation examples”
- Visual: abstract workflow diagram or integration map (tasteful, minimal)

SECTION: Trusted by / logos (optional)
- Row of logo placeholders + short caption “Teams choose us for reliable delivery”

SECTION #services: What we do
Cards (4–6):
- AI workflow automation
- System integrations & API glue
- Internal tools & agents
- Data pipelines & enrichment
- Support & monitoring
Each card: 1-sentence outcome phrasing.

SECTION #use-cases: Automation examples (high priority, above the fold-ish)
Show 6–8 use-case cards with tags:
- Lead intake → CRM → enrichment → routing
- Support triage → summarization → ticket creation
- Finance ops → invoice matching → alerts
- Sales calls → notes → follow-ups → tasks
- Recruiting → screening → scheduling
- Knowledge base → Q&A bot → escalation
Each card has: “Inputs”, “Automates”, “Result” (no numbers).

SECTION #process: How we work
Step timeline (4 steps):
1) Discovery & success criteria
2) Map workflows + data access
3) Build + test + security review
4) Launch + monitor + iterate
Microcopy: “Prefer to talk first? (phone placeholder)”

- “Our stack” mini-grid: tools + platforms

SECTION: Pricing
Two or three tiers:
- “Starter automation”
- “Growth systems”
- “Enterprise program”
Each: what’s included + “Book a discovery call”
Microcopy: “Scope varies by systems and access.”

SECTION: FAQ
6–8 questions focused on delivery, access, security, ownership, maintenance, timelines (no numbers).

SECTION #contact: Contact / booking
- Booking module: external scheduler embed in modal (primary)
