PROMPT — HOME_01 (AI Automation / Integration Agency) (Desktop 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI Automation / Integration Agency”.
Home 1 is primary. Goal: conversion-first, trust-first, enterprise-friendly (not corporate-bloated).
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Reusable sections + global styles. No “magic” product features.

STYLE
Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
One design system shared with Home 2/3 (typography/spacing/buttons/cards).
Distinct hero composition + 1–2 motifs (workflow chips, subtle connector lines, restrained gradients).
Avoid AI clichés (robots/glowing brains). Prefer abstract systems, real teams, integrations.

HARD RULES
- No invented metrics. If needed, use placeholders like “X+”.
- Primary CTA: “Book a discovery call” → external scheduler (modal embed preferred).
- Secondary CTA: “View automation examples” → scroll to #use-cases.
- Keep scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, strong hierarchy.

HEADER (sticky)
Logo left. Nav: Services, Use Cases, Process, Industries, Proof, Pricing, Resources, Contact.
Right: Primary CTA button “Book a discovery call”. Utility link: “Security & compliance”.

HERO (distinct)
H1: “Automate work. Integrate systems. Ship faster.”
Subhead: “We design and deploy AI + workflow automations across your tools—reliably, securely, with measurable outcomes.”
Proof chips (no numbers): “Zapier/Make/n8n”, “OpenAI/Anthropic”, “HubSpot/Salesforce”, “Slack/Google Workspace”.
CTAs: Primary “Book a discovery call” + Secondary “View automation examples”.
Visual: minimal workflow diagram / integration map (tasteful).

SECTION: Logos (optional)

SECTION #services: What we do
4–6 cards, each outcome-led (1 sentence):
- AI workflow automation
- System integrations & API glue
- Internal tools & agents

SECTION #use-cases: Automation examples (high priority)
6–8 use-case cards with small tags. Each card has 3 lines: “Inputs”, “Automates”, “Result” (no numbers).

- Sales calls → notes → follow-ups → tasks

- Knowledge base → Q&A bot → escalation

SECTION #process: How we work
4-step timeline:
1) Discovery & success criteria
2) Map workflows + data access
