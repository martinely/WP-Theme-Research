PROMPT — HOME_01 (AI Automation / Integration Agency) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for an “AI Automation / Integration Agency”.
This is Home 1 (primary). Goal: conversion-first, trust-first, enterprise-friendly (credible), not corporate-bloated.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder assumption: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Reusable sections + global styles.

STYLE (shared design system across all 3 homes)
	•	Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
	•	Avoid AI clichés (robots/brains). Prefer abstract systems, real teams, integration diagrams, dashboard-like UI.
	•	Signature motifs (use 1–2): “workflow chips”, subtle diagram lines/arrows, restrained gradient accent (minimal).
	•	Components: soft cards, clear hierarchy, generous whitespace, crisp typography.

HARD RULES
	•	No invented metrics. No numbers. If needed: “X+”.
	•	Primary CTA must be “Book a discovery call” → external scheduling (modal embed preferred).
	•	Secondary CTA: “View automation examples” → scroll to #use-cases.
	•	Keep copy scannable: short paragraphs, bullets, consistent card patterns.

HEADER (sticky)
	•	Logo (left)
	•	Nav: Services, Use Cases, Process, Industries, Proof, Pricing, Resources, Contact
	•	Right CTA button: “Book a discovery call”
	•	Utility link: “Security & compliance”

HERO (distinct H1 composition)
	•	H1: “Automate work. Integrate systems. Ship faster.”
	•	Subhead: “We design and deploy AI + workflow automation across your tools—reliably, securely, and built for real operations.”
	•	Proof chips (no claims): “Zapier / Make / n8n” · “OpenAI / Anthropic” · “HubSpot / Salesforce” · “Slack / Google Workspace”
	•	CTAs: Primary “Book a discovery call” (modal scheduler) + Secondary “View automation examples”
	•	Visual: minimal integration map / workflow diagram (nodes + connectors) + tiny “workflow chips” as labels.

SECTION: Trusted by (optional)
	•	Logo row placeholders + caption: “Teams choose us for reliable delivery.”

SECTION #services: What we do (4–6 cards)
Card format: Title + 1 sentence outcome + “What’s included” mini bullets.
	1.	AI workflow automation — “Reduce handoffs and manual ops across teams.”
Bullets: triggers/routers, approvals, notifications, exception paths
	2.	Systems integration & API glue — “Connect tools so data moves cleanly.”
Bullets: APIs/webhooks, iPaaS scenarios, event pipelines
	3.	Internal tools & agents — “Assist teams inside the systems they already use.”
Bullets: copilots, retrieval + Q&A, guardrails + evals
	4.	Data enrichment & readiness — “Make inputs usable for automation and AI.”
Bullets: normalization, entity extraction, dedupe, enrichment
	5.	Monitoring & iteration — “Keep automations stable as systems change.”
Bullets: logging, alerts, quality checks, continuous improvement

SECTION #use-cases: Automation examples (high priority; near top)
Grid 6–8 cards. Each card has: Inputs / Automates / Result (no numbers).
A) Lead intake → Inputs: form + email / Automates: enrich → route → CRM create / Result: “Faster follow-up, cleaner pipeline.”
B) Support triage → Inputs: tickets + chat / Automates: summarize → classify → assign / Result: “Less queue noise, clearer handoffs.”
C) Finance ops → Inputs: invoices + POs / Automates: match → flag exceptions → notify / Result: “Fewer surprises, better control.”
D) Sales calls → Inputs: meeting audio / Automates: notes → follow-ups → tasks / Result: “Consistent next steps, less admin.”
E) Recruiting → Inputs: applicants / Automates: screen → schedule → update ATS / Result: “Smoother candidate flow.”
F) Knowledge assistant → Inputs: docs + FAQs / Automates: answer → cite → escalate / Result: “Better self-serve, safer escalation.”
(Optionals: onboarding ops, inventory alerts, compliance routing)

SECTION #process: How we work (4-step timeline)
	1.	Discovery & success criteria — “Define what ‘good’ looks like.”
	2.	Workflow + data mapping — “Inputs, systems, permissions, edge cases.”
	3.	Build + test + security review — “Staging, QA, access controls.”
	4.	Launch + monitor + iterate — “Observability + continuous improvement.”
Microcopy under CTA: “Prefer to talk first? (phone placeholder)”

SECTION: Industries (grid 6–10)
SaaS · Agencies · eCommerce · Healthcare (non-clinical ops) · Finance · Real estate · Logistics · Education · Professional services
Disclaimer line: “We tailor to your data, access, and compliance needs.”

SECTION #proof: Proof & credibility
	•	Case studies (3 cards): Problem → Approach → Outcome (no numbers)
Example headings:
	1.	“From manual routing to reliable workflow automation”
	2.	“Integrations that removed spreadsheet ops”
	3.	“Assistive agent that improved internal response quality”
	•	Testimonials (2–3): quote + name/role placeholders (no logos required)
	•	“Our stack” mini-grid: Integration / Data / AI / Observability tool chips (generic)

SECTION: Pricing (2–3 tiers; no numbers)
Microcopy: “Scope varies by systems and access.”
Tier 1: Starter automation — “One high-impact workflow, shipped safely.”
Tier 2: Growth systems — “Multiple workflows + integrations across teams.”
Tier 3: Enterprise program — “Ongoing delivery + governance + monitoring.”
Each tier: bullets “Best for / Includes / You get” + CTA “Book a discovery call”.

SECTION: FAQ (6–8; practical + trust)
	•	“What access do you need to integrate our tools?”
	•	“How do you handle security and data boundaries?”
	•	“Do you build in our stack or yours?”
	•	“Who owns the workflows and assets after delivery?”
	•	“How do you handle changes when tools update?”
