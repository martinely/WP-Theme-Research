PROMPT — INNER-00 (About / Company) — AI Agency Theme (3 Homes) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme INNER PAGE template (desktop only) for the niche: “AI Automation / Integration Agency” with two additional homepage variants in the same theme:
- Home 1: AI Automation / Integration Agency (primary)
- Home 2: AI micro-SaaS products
- Home 3: AI trainers / consultants

This prompt is for the shared INNER template: About / Company.
It must work for all three homes via content + module toggles, while keeping ONE design system.

CANVAS / GRID
- Desktop only: 1440w, 12-col grid, 1200px centered container, 24px gutters
- One frame only (no mobile, no toggle)

BUILDER ASSUMPTION
- WordPress theme template intended for Elementor + Elementor Pro
- Use reusable sections + global tokens (typography, spacing, buttons, cards)

STYLE (shared system)
- Modern, high-end, confident. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
- Avoid generic AI clichés (robots/brains). Prefer abstract systems, real teams, subtle diagrams, restrained gradients.
- Signature motifs allowed: “workflow chips”, thin connector lines, micro-diagram separators.
- Card radius 16; large panels 20; soft shadows; generous whitespace; accessible contrast.

HARD RULES
- Facts only: Do NOT invent metrics, awards, client logos, certifications, locations, or timelines.
- If a number is needed, use placeholders: “X+”, “Since 20XX”, “$X”, “X weeks”.
- If compliance/security is referenced, keep it generic and optional (“Security & compliance approach”)—no claims.

PAGE GOAL
Build trust + clarity:
- Who we are
- What we believe (delivery philosophy)
- How we work (approach)
- Who leads / team credibility
