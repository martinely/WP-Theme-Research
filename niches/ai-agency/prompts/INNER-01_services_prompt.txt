PROMPT — INNER-01 (Services / Offerings Index) — AI Agency Theme (3 Homes) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme INNER PAGE template (desktop only) for the niche: “AI Automation / Integration Agency” with two additional homepage variants in the same theme:
- Home 1: AI Automation / Integration Agency (primary)
- Home 2: AI micro-SaaS products
- Home 3: AI trainers / consultants

This prompt is for the shared INNER template: Services / Offerings Index.
It must support three modes via toggles/content:
- Mode A (Home 1): Agency services (capabilities)
- Mode B (Home 2): Product suite index (micro-SaaS products)
- Mode C (Home 3): Training programs index (courses/workshops/consulting)

- Reusable sections + global tokens
- No fake data. No invented metrics/clients/certifications.

STYLE (shared system)
