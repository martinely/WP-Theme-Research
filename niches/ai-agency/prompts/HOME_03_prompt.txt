PROMPT — HOME_03 (AI Trainers / Consultants) — Research → Blueprint + Copy (EN)

ROLE
Senior UX strategist + education conversion copywriter + WP theme IA (Elementor + Pro).

GOAL
Create Home 3 blueprint for “AI trainers / consultants” (courses, workshops, corporate training, advisory). This homepage should drive: course inquiry, workshop booking, and lead capture.

INPUTS (WEIGHTED)
Primary (education & training orgs, HIGH weight): use ONLY niches/ai-agency/sources/HOME_03_URL_POOL.txt
Secondary (ThemeForest, MEDIUM weight): use ONLY niches/ai-agency/sources/TF_LINKS.txt
No other websites.

HARD RULES
- EN only. Facts only. Unknown/Inaccessible.
- Do NOT invent placement rates, salaries, cohort size, certifications, partner logos.
- Evidence URLs max 12 total. No tables.

SCOPE
Per real site:
- Open Home + at least 2 pages if available (Programs/Courses, Corporate training, About/Instructors, Apply/Contact).
- Extract patterns suitable for a theme.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
A) REAL-SITE PATTERNS (Home 3)
Group bullets by: Header/Nav, Hero, Program catalog preview, Corporate training block, Instructor credibility, Outcomes framing, Curriculum preview, Testimonials, FAQ, Enrollment/Contact.
Each bullet: Pattern + note + Evidence URL.
Label “Enterprise-only” if it requires a big platform / complex directory.

B) HOME_03 BLUEPRINT (education-led structure)
- Section order
- CTA logic: primary “Book a workshop / Talk to an advisor” + secondary “View programs”
- Anchor IDs: #programs #corporate #instructors #curriculum #testimonials #contact

C) READY-TO-USE COPY (Home 3)
Write realistic copy:
- H1 + subhead + 2 CTAs
- Program cards (6)
- Corporate training pitch block
- Instructor snapshot (3)
- Curriculum preview bullets
- FAQ (6)
- Contact microcopy (“We’ll respond within 1 business day.”)

D) ELEMENTOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- CPT: Programs, Instructors, Testimonials
- Reusable sections: program grid, instructor cards, curriculum accordion, inquiry form block

IMPORTANT EMPHASIS FOR HOME_03
- Credibility = instructors + curriculum + proof of outcomes, but without fabricated metrics.
- Clear segmentation: individuals vs teams/corporate.
