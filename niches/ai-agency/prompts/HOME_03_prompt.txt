PROMPT — HOME_03 (AI Trainers / Consultants) (Desktop, 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for “AI Trainers / Consultants”.
This is Home 3 (secondary). Use the SAME global design system as Home 1 (typography, spacing, buttons, card radii, header/footer), but a DISTINCT hero composition and section order.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only (no mobile).
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only. Reusable sections + global styles. No “magic” LMS features.

GOAL
Sell training + consulting programs with credibility, curriculum clarity, and booking conversion.
No invented stats. If a number is needed, use placeholders like “X sessions”, “X weeks”, “# learners”.

STYLE
High-end, credible, human-first. Tech-forward but warm (not sterile).
Avoid cliché AI visuals. Prefer workshop photography, annotated curriculum cards, subtle “framework” diagrams.
Use shared signature motifs (workflow chips / subtle connector lines) but adapt to “learning + adoption” context.

HARD UX RULES
- Primary CTA must be “Book a consultation” and must route to an external scheduler embed/link pattern (modal embed preferred).
- Secondary CTA: “View programs” (scroll to #programs).
- Keep scannable: clear headings, short paragraphs, bullets, consistent card patterns.
- No fake certifications, no fake partner logos, no fake outcome metrics.

ANCHORS (annotate small): #programs #formats #curriculum #instructors #teams #proof #resources #faq #contact
