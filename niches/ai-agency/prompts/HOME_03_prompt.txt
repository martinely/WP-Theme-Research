PROMPT — HOME_03 (AI Trainers / Consultants) (Desktop 1440)

Design a premium WordPress theme homepage (desktop only) for “AI Trainers / Consultants”.
Home 3 (secondary). Same global design system as Home 1 (header/footer/tokens), but distinct hero + section order.
Canvas: 1440w, 12-col grid, container 1200 centered, gutter 24. One frame only.
Builder: Elementor + Elementor Pro only.

GOAL
Sell training + consulting programs with strong credibility, curriculum clarity, and booking CTA.
No invented stats. Use placeholders like “X sessions” if needed.

STYLE
Warm, confident, workshop-led. Less “software UI”, more “people + curriculum”.
Use tasteful photography placeholders + structured curriculum cards.

Nav: Programs, For Teams, For Individuals, Curriculum, Instructors, Resources, Contact.
Primary CTA button: “Book a consultation” (external scheduler modal pattern).
