STEP: TF-02 Winner Deep Dive (AI Agency theme) — audit-ready

TARGET THEME (winner from TF-01):
Neuros — https://themeforest.net/item/neuros-ai-agency-technology-wordpress-theme/52246267

GOAL
Produce an audit-ready deep dive of the winner theme to extract:
1) What exactly it ships (facts only)
2) The demo IA / section patterns relevant to our 3-home strategy
3) Conversion/lead-capture patterns (forms vs booking vs CTA paths)
4) Reliability / support / bugs signals from comments (audit format)

CONTEXT (our product)
One WordPress theme with ONE design system, but 3 distinct homepages:
HOME-01: AI Automation / Integration Agency (primary)
HOME-02: AI micro-SaaS products
HOME-03: AI trainers / consultants
We want distinct hero + distinct sections order per home, but shared components/tokens.

HARD RULES
- Facts only unless explicitly labeled “Inference”.
- If not visible: write “Unknown”.
- If blocked: write “Inaccessible”.
- Evidence URLs must be explicit page URLs you opened (listing / demo / comment page, plus any deep demo subpages if you use them).
- No invented stats (sales, dates, counts). Use exact values visible on the listing or “Unknown”.
- Booking: if no external scheduling integration is shown, say “Not shown”. Do NOT assume Calendly etc.

PAGES TO OPEN (minimum)
1) ThemeForest listing (Neuros)
2) Live demo home (root demo URL)
3) At least 2 additional demo pages:
   - One “Services/What we do” style page (or closest)
   - One “Contact/Lead” page (or closest)
4) ThemeForest comments tab

IF MULTIPLE DEMOS / HOME VARIANTS EXIST
- Identify up to 3 demo home variants that best map to our 3 homes:
  - Agency (H1)
  - SaaS/product (H2)
  - Training/consulting (H3)
If not available, mark missing ones as “Unknown” and don’t force-fit.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

A) Listing facts (with evidence URLs per bullet)
- Theme name, author, exact Created date, exact Last update date, exact price, exact sales (or Unknown)
- Tech stack signals visible on listing (builder, plugins required, WooCommerce, performance claims) — facts only
- Import/demo setup promises (facts only)
- License/support period wording (facts only)

B) Demo IA patterns (map to our 3 homes)
For each identified demo home variant (max 3):
- Demo name/label (if any) + exact demo URL
- Above-the-fold: H1 style, subhead style, primary CTA label, secondary CTA label, proof elements
- Section order (top → bottom) as a bullet sequence
- Reusable component patterns (cards, icon grids, case studies, pricing blocks, testimonials, FAQ, stats, logos, comparison tables, etc.)
- Conversion path: where CTA goes (anchor, contact page, form section, pricing, checkout, etc.)

C) Lead capture + “booking” reality (facts only)
- What lead capture exists: contact form fields, newsletter, chat widget, quote request, etc.
- Any external scheduler shown? If none: “Not shown”.
- Any gating patterns (popup, sticky CTA, floating buttons) and exact locations.

D) Design system extraction (facts + small inferences)
- Colors/typography tone (Inference allowed, clearly labeled)
- Layout density: spacing, section rhythm, grid usage (Inference)
- Signature UI motifs (facts): gradients, blobs, glassmorphism, icon style, motion cues, etc.
- What is reusable across our 3 homes vs what should differ (Inference)

E) Comments (AUDIT format, 10 items)
For 10 distinct issues/questions/praises:
- Exact comments URL (must be the ThemeForest comments page URL)
- Comment date + commenter name (as shown)
- 5–10 word excerpt (verbatim)
- Issue label (e.g., demo import, fatal error, Elementor, WP version, performance, support speed, docs, mobile bug)
If you cannot reliably capture date/name/excerpt: mark “Unknown source” and keep only a general issue.

F) “Beat the winner” opportunity notes (grounded)
- 5 concrete product opportunities derived from facts in A–E
- Each opportunity must cite at least one evidence URL (listing/demo/comments) and/or be an Inference explicitly labeled

EVIDENCE URL RULE
- Put the evidence URL inline at the end of each bullet.
- Max 12 evidence URLs total; choose the most representative.

LANGUAGE
Output in EN only.
No tables unless the section explicitly asks for an audit list.
