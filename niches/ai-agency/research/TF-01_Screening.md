B) Winner decision – competitor to beat (≤120 words)
Selected theme: Neuros – AI Agency & Technology WordPress Theme. Neuros stands out because it has the highest sales among the competitors (over 3 k sales[23]) and offers multiple AI‑oriented demos with rich layouts such as service cards, pricing tables and a built‑in contact form[25][26]. These features make it a strong benchmark for agencies seeking AI integration and consulting websites. Despite its popularity, many comments report fatal errors and demo‑import problems[38][39], which suggests an opportunity for a more stable, reliable theme. By building a secure, easily customizable alternative with distinct homepages for agency, micro‑SaaS and training, we can surpass Neuros while learning from its successful layout and features.
C) Hypotheses – how to outperform these themes
	1.	Dedicated homepages for each persona: Provide three distinct home layouts (agency, micro‑SaaS and trainer) with tailored hero messages, service sections and conversion funnels, instead of the generic or repetitive demos seen in competitors.
	2.	Streamlined lead capture: Incorporate built‑in multi‑step forms and scheduling widgets (e.g., Calendly) accessible from the hero section to improve conversion, addressing the lack of visible forms in some competitors (Lumi and Piku)[37].
	3.	Reliability and security: Build the theme with minimal dependencies and harden plugins to avoid fatal errors and security vulnerabilities reported in ANN and Neuros comments[40][38].
	4.	Simplified demo import: Offer a lightweight one‑click importer with clear progress and error handling to avoid the demo‑import issues noted in Aiero and Neuros comments[38].
	5.	Clear documentation & support: Provide detailed onboarding and self‑service documentation; emphasise accessibility and performance to meet modern standards and avoid the UI bugs and missing CSS problems raised in Lumi’s comments[41].
