C) Home‑01 template translation (for a WordPress theme)

Must‑have blocks (small‑agency friendly)
	•	Clear hero banner: A bold headline conveying the agency’s positioning (who they help and what problem they solve) with 1–2 primary CTAs. Use prominent contrast and concise subcopy (e.g., “Intelligence Unleashed – amplified by AI, scaled by automation”).
	•	Services / Capabilities overview: A section summarising the core services with icons or cards; for small agencies, limit to 3–5 categories (e.g., AI automation, AI consulting, data engineering).
	•	Proof strip: Logos of clients/partners and a metrics bar (e.g., hours saved, percentage improvements) to quickly establish credibility ￼.
	•	Case study or success teaser: A short story or card linking to detailed work; emphasise outcomes such as time saved or cost reduction ￼.
	•	Process / methodology steps: A simple visual of the agency’s approach (e.g., Discovery → Design → Build → Manage) similar to Ashling’s service lifecycle ￼.
	•	Testimonials/Quotes: A slider or card with 2–3 client quotes to build trust, similar to Strong’s testimonial section.
	•	CTA band: A full‑width section with a strong call‑to‑action (e.g., “Book your discovery call” or “Get in touch”).
	•	Footer: Contact information, navigation links, legal details and social icons.

Enterprise‑only patterns to avoid or optionalise
	•	Heavy compliance/security messaging (Booz Allen’s Responsible/Secure AI slides) – optional for small agencies.
	•	Large multi‑section insight libraries and career portals – unnecessary complexity; provide a simple blog/resource hub instead.
	•	Complex mega‑menus – keep navigation simple; avoid deep drop‑downs used by large firms (Marlabs, Booz Allen).
	•	Region selector and multi‑language options – optional unless targeting international clients.
	•	Partner certification badges – include only if the agency has recognised partnerships; otherwise omit.

Recommended default CTA & fallback
	•	Primary default CTA: “Book a free consultation” (links to a calendar or enquiry form). This aligns with several sites (Strong, Quandary) and encourages qualified leads.
	•	Fallback CTA: “Contact us” or “Send a message” via a simple form for visitors not ready to book.  Ensure CTAs remain visible in the header and repeated in the hero and footer.

Recommended proof hierarchy (what to show first)
	1.	Client logos / partner logos: Immediately after the hero to establish credibility.
	2.	Quantified outcomes: Follow logos with metrics or succinct proof points (e.g., “40 % tasks automated” ￼, “7× faster document processing” ￼).
	3.	Case study teaser: Provide a snapshot of a successful project with a link to read more.
	4.	Testimonials: End with human quotes to reinforce trust.
	5.	Certifications / badges: Place near the footer or within the proof strip for optional credibility.

	2.	Hero variants – Multiple hero templates with headline, subcopy, background image/graphic, and up to two CTA buttons.
	3.	Services / Capabilities cards – A flexible grid to showcase 3–5 service categories, each with icon, title, short description and a link to learn more.

	6.	Process / How we work – Visual stepper or timeline illustrating the agency’s methodology (e.g., discovery → design → build → manage).
	7.	Testimonial slider – Carousel or card slider for client quotes and names.
	8.	Industry / Use‑case section – Optional grid to showcase industries served or specific use cases with icons.
	9.	Platform/Product highlights – Optional section to feature proprietary platforms or technology offerings (similar to Strong RL, ML, Vision).
