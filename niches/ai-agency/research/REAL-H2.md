The Home‑02 pattern is focused on AI micro‑SaaS products that help users record, transcribe and summarize meetings. To build a WordPress theme with three distinct homepages, we analysed accessible websites from the provided URL pool. Each site card below summarises the factual patterns observed on the home page and two priority inner pages (pricing and product/use‑case/solution). When a page could not be accessed via the research environment, this is marked as “No”. Citations point back to verifiable statements from the sites.

C) Small‑theme translation (component recommendations)
The research reveals common patterns that should guide the Home‑02 template design:
Components to include
Hero section – a prominent headline summarising the product’s value proposition, accompanied by one or two CTAs (sign‑up/free trial and demo or contact). Add optional sub‑text and trust badges.
Feature/benefits section – use cards or stacked rows to outline key capabilities (e.g., AI notes, summaries, action items, integrations). Many sites employ icons or simple illustrations to communicate benefits.
Integration/support row – show logos of supported video platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) and integrations with CRMs or productivity tools. This section builds credibility and helps users see compatibility.
Security/trust bar – a narrow strip or block containing compliance badges (SOC‑2, GDPR, HIPAA), ratings (G2 score) or customer logos. This pattern reassures visitors about data privacy and reliability.
Use‑case/solutions section – optional grid or carousel to present different personas or teams (Sales, Marketing, HR, etc.) with tailored benefits. It helps visitors identify with the product’s value.
Testimonials or quotes – short quotes from customers or reviewers add social proof. They’re commonly placed near the bottom of the page.
Footer with pricing/CTA – a final call to action encouraging visitors to sign up or book a demo, with links to pricing, resources and support.
These components should be built using Elementor‑friendly blocks such as sections, columns, icon boxes, buttons and testimonial widgets. A consistent design system (colours, typography, spacing) should tie them together so that three unique homepages can still share core components.
Enterprise‑only elements to avoid
Complex admin controls – features like custom SSO, fine‑grained data retention policies and advanced team management (seen in many enterprise plans) should not be hard‑coded into the theme. Instead, provide modular pricing tables where such options can be added via content rather than baked into the layout.
Excessive plan tiers – the theme should accommodate 2–4 plans; avoid rigid structures that assume a fixed number of tiers or enterprise‑only options.
Deep security documentation – separate pages like full trust centres or long compliance documentation (e.g., Grain’s security page) can be linked to rather than embedded in the homepage.
Overly corporate imagery – since micro‑SaaS products appeal to smaller teams and individuals, avoid visuals that look exclusively “enterprise.” Use friendly illustrations or product screenshots instead.

This research report summarises factual patterns across current AI micro‑SaaS products. These insights inform the design of the Home‑02 template by highlighting common navigation labels, CTAs, home sections and trust elements, ensuring the theme aligns with user expectations while maintaining flexibility for future products.
