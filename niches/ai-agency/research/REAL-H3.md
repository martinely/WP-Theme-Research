This report summarises ten websites that position themselves as AI trainers or consultants. Each site
was explored for its home and at least two inner pages (courses/programmes, corporate training/
teams, about/instructors, pricing/contact). When pages were inaccessible or heavily scripted the site
was marked accordingly. Observations focus on the offerings, target audiences, programme structures
and notable differentiators.

Reliable Bits – reliablebits.io
•
•

training provider. The About page expresses the mission to build exceptional digital products
with teams that “feel like your own” and highlights values such as Build with Purpose,

Team: The founding team includes Deepak Devjani (founder & head of machine learning),
Greg Battle (principal) and engineering directors Vir Chan and Jytten Shakya. No pages
describing AI training or education programmes were accessible, so this site is marked not
clearly offering AI training.
Northwest AI Consulting (NWAI) – nwai.co
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Why training matters: The AI Training & Education Services page argues that enterprises
need training to close skills gaps, prevent AI implementation failures, overcome resistance to
27
change and gain competitive advantage .

value.
Technical AI training (2–8 weeks) consisting of hands‑on workshops covering AI techniques and
tools.

27
programmes, and ongoing support/mentoring .
Industry‑specific tracks & FAQs: Training is tailored to industries (construction, banking,
healthcare, natural resources, real estate, retail, marketing, small business) and remote
participation is available. FAQs note that executive briefings run 1–2 days while technical training
lasts 2–8 weeks, include guides and tools, can be done remotely and can accommodate mixed
28
skill levels .

Portland in 2021. The founding team comprises Awais Tariq (chief research officer; custom
retrieval‑augmented generation expert), Asad Malik (chief technology officer; generative‑AI
specialist on AWS) and Wyatt Mayham (head of AI consulting; pharmaceutical‑industry veteran).
3

29
rigorous risk management. Its workforce is highly educated (62 % PhD, 31 % MSc, 7 % BSc) .
General Assembly – generalassemb.ly
•
•
•
AI education & upskilling: The AI Academy defines an AI journey with three stages:
AI‑Enabled (employees gain foundational AI knowledge and role‑specific modules for
productivity), AI‑Augmented (AI becomes part of strategic decision‑making, cross‑departmental
scaling and ethical use) and AI‑Superpowered (leadership drives AI innovation and develops
new AI solutions) 30
. Target audiences include C‑suite/senior leaders, HR & learning/
31
development managers and technical/operational leaders .
Implementation: Companies sign up, tailor training to roles and business goals and deliver
training via practical exercises and real‑world case studies 32
. Customisation options include
expert speakers, guided post‑training support, in‑person or online delivery, industry‑specific
content, language flexibility and AI‑readiness assessments 33
. Participant testimonials praise
34
the depth of knowledge, interactive sessions and relevance of real‑world examples .
Agentic AI Fundamentals: A three‑hour workshop where participants design, build and deploy
their first AI agent team using CrewAI. Both technical (Python) and non‑technical (UI‑based)
tracks are offered. Learners collaborate with peers and leave with a functioning workflow and
35
the confidence to implement AI agents in their organisations .
Correlation One – correlation-one.com
•
Limited access: Many pages on correlation‑one.com load dynamic content that cannot be
parsed in this environment. A snippet from a white‑paper landing page notes that people
leaders should guide their teams from “AI panic to an AI plan” by learning the technology
36
themselves and ensuring employees understand how to apply it for maximum impact .
Beyond this, no comprehensive programme descriptions were accessible, so this site is marked
as partially unknown.

Frameworks or prompt
libraries 2
Bizzuka’s AI Strategy Canvas and Notion prompt library and
NWAI’s custom curriculum structure emphasise frameworks
for scalable prompting.
C) Small‑theme translation (Home‑03 pattern)
Websites following the “AI trainers / consultants” pattern share several common themes:
1.
2.
Executive‑first messaging: Most sites emphasise that AI adoption starts with leadership.
Bootcamps, executive briefings and business‑leader programmes promise to help C‑suite and
VP‑level teams understand AI’s strategic value, align AI initiatives with business goals and rapidly
achieve ROI 2 27
. Even technical programmes frequently begin with an overview for
8
decision‑makers .
Role‑ or industry‑specific curricula: Instead of one‑size‑fits‑all training, providers offer tailored
learning paths for marketing, HR, technical teams, small‑business owners or entire
5
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
organisations. This customisation aims to close specific skills gaps and ensure learners can apply
31
AI within their domain .
Emphasis on generative AI and prompt engineering: Generative tools (ChatGPT, Copilot,
DALL‑E, CrewAI) are central to many curricula. Courses teach prompt‑writing, iteration, scalable
prompting and building custom agents or bots 11 18
. Frameworks like Bizzuka’s AI
Strategy Canvas structure how prompts align with objectives.
Hands‑on practice and real‑world projects: Programmes stress experiential learning—
students build bots, agents or prompt libraries, complete projects that showcase AI skills or work
through real‑world case studies. This approach signals that participants will be able to
12 35
implement AI immediately after training .
Support beyond the classroom: Many providers offer ongoing mentoring, access to tool
libraries, certification or assessments, integration with organisational LMS/SSO and analytics to
track impact 23 27
. This suggests a shift from one‑off workshops to continuous upskilling.
Responsible AI messaging: Ethical considerations, bias mitigation, privacy and AI governance
appear in several programmes (e.g., Udacity’s business‑leaders course and Pluralsight’s ethics
modules). Providers position themselves as guides to responsible and human‑centred AI
11
adoption.
Marketing through success metrics and thought leadership: Sites often highlight ROI metrics
(hours saved, percentage reductions in admin work), feature blog posts or white papers
1 21
discussing AI use cases and tout large user bases or corporate clients .
Overall, the Home‑03 pattern showcases organisations that combine education, consulting and tools
to accelerate AI adoption. They target leadership and teams simultaneously, emphasise customisation
and hands‑on practice, and position themselves as partners in an ongoing AI transformation rather
than simple course vendors.
