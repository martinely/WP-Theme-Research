REAL-SUM-CLEAN (v2) — AI Agency Theme (One theme, 3 homes)

A) Coverage

Inputs present: REAL-H1, REAL-H2, REAL-H3.  ￼
	•	Home 1 (AI Automation / Integration Agency): Review covers multiple agencies/consultancies; at least two sites were reported inaccessible (Cloudflare / connection issues). Evidence URLs inside REAL-H1 include examples like Ashling services/about pages, qBotica workflows/case studies, Marlabs AI services, Zia IDP/about, Booz Allen AI case study, Strong expertise/work pages.  ￼
	•	Home 2 (AI micro-SaaS products): Review covers meeting notes/transcription products; at least one site reported inaccessible; some inner pages (e.g., pricing) may be partially inaccessible for a site. Evidence URL list is provided in REAL-H2.  ￼
	•	Home 3 (AI trainers / consultants): Review covers training providers and consultancies; at least one site noted as only partially observable due to dynamic rendering; one site may be mismatched to the pool (not primarily AI training). Evidence URL list + frequency notes are provided in REAL-H3.  ￼

Audit note: When a site is marked inaccessible/partial in the REAL files, it is excluded from “counts”. Any “counts” below are only stated where they are explicitly supported by the REAL files; otherwise marked Unknown.

B) Cross-home common patterns (shared system)

(Only patterns that appear across at least 2 of the 3 homes.)
	1.	Hero with clear value proposition + 1–2 primary CTAs

	•	H1 commonly uses “Explore services / Contact / Book discovery” style CTAs.  ￼
	•	H2 commonly uses “Start free / Get started / Request demo” style CTAs.  ￼
	•	H3 commonly uses “Explore programs / Talk to sales / Book briefing” style CTAs.  ￼

	2.	Offer overview directly after hero (cards/grid)

	•	H1: services/capabilities categories (often lifecycle or pillars).  ￼
	•	H2: feature/benefit stacks + integrations.  ￼
	•	H3: programs/courses/tracks overview.  ￼

	3.	Trust layer near the top (logos / metrics / badges / ratings)

	•	H1: client logos + outcome metrics + partner badges (varies by site).  ￼
	•	H2: compliance badges/claims + ratings + customer logos (varies by product).  ￼
	•	H3: learner counts / corporate clients / instructor credibility (varies by provider).  ￼

	4.	Proof content blocks (case studies, testimonials, success stories)

	•	H1: case studies are common; testimonials appear on some sites.  ￼
	•	H2: testimonials/ratings commonly appear, sometimes вместо дълги case studies.  ￼

	5.	Strong end-cap CTA band + conversion endpoint

	•	H1: contact form and/or calendar booking.  ￼
	•	H2: sign-up flow + demo request flow.  ￼
	•	H3: inquiry / sales contact / program enrollment.  ￼

C) Differences by home (what must differ)

Home 1 — AI Automation / Integration Agency (primary)
	•	Core promise: “We implement/scale automation & AI in your business” (agency posture).  ￼
	•	Section order (typical): Hero → trust strip → services/capabilities → methodology/process (often) → case studies → testimonials (optional) → contact/booking CTA.  ￼
	•	Pricing: usually not transparent; packaged as capabilities, lifecycle stages, or accelerators.  ￼
	•	Must-have modules: services grid, methodology/stepper, case study cards, metrics strip, contact + booking endpoints.  ￼

Home 2 — AI micro-SaaS products
	•	Core promise: “Product benefit now” (accuracy, summaries, action items, collaboration).  ￼
	•	Section order (typical): Hero → benefits/features → integrations → security/trust → use-cases/personas (optional) → pricing → testimonials/ratings → CTA.  ￼
	•	Pricing: typically visible, 2–4 tiers, enterprise “contact sales” variant (where observed).  ￼
	•	Must-have modules: pricing table, integrations strip, security/compliance bar, testimonial/ratings band, dual CTA (free start + demo).  ￼

Home 3 — AI trainers / consultants
	•	Core promise: enablement + adoption (bootcamps, workshops, role tracks, executive training).  ￼
	•	Section order (typical): Hero → programs/tracks → curriculum/modules → instructor credibility → outcomes/ROI proof → inquiry CTA; pricing is optional (mixed).  ￼
	•	Pricing: mixed (some subscription tiers; many “contact sales/consultation”).  ￼
	•	Must-have modules: program cards, curriculum/agenda layout, instructor bios, outcomes/metrics, corporate training CTA.  ￼

⸻

D) Enterprise-only patterns to avoid (or make optional)
	•	Mega-menus, deep multi-program IA, region selectors (common on large consultancies).  ￼
	•	Heavy governance/security storytelling as default (keep as optional module).  ￼
	•	Overbuilt “trust centers” / SSO admin documentation baked into the theme (link-out is enough).  ￼
	•	Huge resource libraries / careers portals as default (provide slim “Resources” templates).  ￼

⸻
