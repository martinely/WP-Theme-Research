This document synthesises the research contained in the three REAL files (REAL‑H1, REAL‑H2, REAL‑H3) into one audit‑ready summary. It is organised to support the design of a single WordPress theme that can power three distinct homepages: Home 1 – AI automation/integration agency, Home 2 – AI micro‑SaaS products, and Home 3 – AI trainers/consultants. It follows the required structure (coverage, patterns, differences, enterprise exclusions and component inventory) and cites only facts from the REAL files.
A) Coverage
Input file	Present?	Accessible site count (from REAL files)	Blockers/Inaccessible notes
REAL‑H1 (AI automation/integration agency)	Yes	Nine accessible sites were fully reviewed (Ashling, Accelirate, qBotica, Marlabs, Zia Consulting, Quandary Consulting Group, AI Agency NY, Booz Allen Hamilton and Strong Analytics). Two sites (Kategos and IAV Consults) were inaccessible due to Cloudflare or connection errors.	Kategos and IAV Consults returned protection errors and could not be inspected.
REAL‑H2 (AI micro‑SaaS products)	Yes	Nine sites were accessible (Otter, Fireflies, Read, Fellow, Fathom, Supernormal, Grain, Sembly and Descript). Reclaim.ai was inaccessible in the research environment; Descript’s pricing and features pages were unavailable.	Reclaim.ai could not be loaded; Descript’s pricing page returned blank content.
REAL‑H3 (AI trainers/consultants)	Yes	Ten sites were reviewed: Elevate AI, Udacity, Pluralsight, Noble Desktop, Bizzuka, Learn Prompting, Reliable Bits, Northwest AI Consulting (NWAI), General Assembly and Correlation One. Reliable Bits did not offer AI training and Correlation One’s dynamic content limited observation.	Correlation One’s pages loaded dynamic content that was not fully parsable. Reliable Bits appears to be a software consultancy rather than an AI trainer.
Summary: All three REAL files were available. Home 1 and Home 3 each analyse multiple agencies/educators, while Home 2 focuses on SaaS products. A small number of sites were inaccessible; those have been noted and are excluded from pattern counts.
B) Cross‑home common patterns (shared system)
Common top navigation items
Across all homes, certain navigation labels recur. In Home 1, Services/Capabilities, About/Company, Industries, Resources/Knowledge Hub and Contact appear on most sites. Home 2 sites typically include Pricing, Features/Product, Solutions or Use‑cases, Enterprise and Resources/Blog alongside a Sign in link, reflecting the SaaS model. Home 3 sites often have Programmes/Courses, Corporate or Team Training, For Business, About/Instructors, Blog/Resources, Contact and sometimes Pricing/Plans.
Common homepage section blocks
The following blocks recur across the homes:
Hero banner with positioning statement and primary CTA: All accessible sites lead with a bold headline and 1–2 calls‑to‑action. Home 2 emphasises product benefits such as accurate transcription and summarisation, while Home 3 highlights executive education or AI adoption.
Services/Features overview: Agencies provide a capabilities overview (e.g., Discover/Advise/Deliver for Ashling, or People/Process/Systems for Quandary). SaaS products outline key features (AI notes, summaries, integrations, analytics). Training sites describe programmes or curricula such as bootcamps, workshops and role‑specific tracks.
Proof/trust strip: Many sites display client or partner logos, metrics and badges. Agencies highlight logos and quantified outcomes like hours saved or cost reductions. SaaS products show compliance badges (SOC‑2, GDPR, HIPAA) and ratings. Training providers cite learner counts, completion rates and corporate clients.
Case study or testimonial section: Agencies and trainers often include case study teasers or testimonial sliders; SaaS products usually add a short testimonial or quote near the bottom.
CTA band or contact form: A full‑width call‑to‑action encourages visitors to book a consultation, start a free trial or schedule a demo. Contact forms appear in all agency and training sites.
Footer with additional links: All homes include a footer containing navigation links, contact details and legal information (not explicitly cited but evident across examples).
Common CTA types and destinations
Contact‑based CTAs: Agencies heavily use “Contact Us” or “Get in touch” buttons leading to a form. Training sites offer “Contact sales” or “Request consultation” for corporate programmes.
Free trial / sign‑up: Micro‑SaaS products universally promote “Start for free”, “Get started” or “Try it free” CTAs that lead directly to sign‑up.
Demo or discovery call: Many agencies and SaaS sites offer demos or booking forms, such as “Book your discovery”, “Schedule demo” or “Request demo”.
Learn more / explore services: Secondary CTAs invite visitors to read internal pages or explore services, especially on agency sites【573516015847976†L366-L365】.
Common trust signals
Client and partner logos: Most agencies and some SaaS products show a strip of logos from recognised clients or partners. Training providers also cite corporate clients to build credibility.
Case studies or quantified results: Agencies and trainers use metrics such as hours saved, percentage reductions or learner completion rates.
Testimonials/quotes: Selected client quotes or learner testimonials appear on several sites.
Compliance badges and certifications: SaaS products frequently display SOC‑2, GDPR or HIPAA badges, while training sites mention certifications or credentialing options.
C) Differences by home (what must differ)
Home 1 – AI Automation/Integration Agency
Hero pattern: Agencies promise to unlock business value through intelligent automation and AI solutions. Headings emphasise building AI agents, end‑to‑end automation or improving operational efficiency (e.g., “Intelligence Unleashed – amplified by AI, scaled by automation” for Ashling, “We build AI agents” for Accelirate). The primary CTA is usually “Contact Us” or “Book a free consultation”, and the secondary CTA may be “Explore our services”.
Section order priorities: Top sections typically include 1) hero with positioning statement and CTA; 2) proof strip or metrics bar showing logos and outcomes; 3) services/capabilities overview (3–5 categories); 4) process or methodology steps (e.g., discover→advise→deliver→manage); 5) case study or success teaser; 6) testimonial slider; 7) final CTA band or contact form.
Proof emphasis: Agencies rely on business outcomes (hours saved, cost reductions) and client logos. Case studies and testimonials are used to demonstrate ROI.
Pricing presence: Pricing is rarely published. Offerings are packaged as service categories or accelerators rather than price tiers. Visitors are encouraged to enquire via contact forms or book a consultation.
Content objects needed: Service cards, process timeline/stepper, metrics bar, client logo carousel, case study cards, testimonial slider and a lead‑capture form.
Home 2 – AI Micro‑SaaS Products
Hero pattern: Product sites lead with a concise value proposition describing how the tool transcribes, summarises or assists meetings, along with a “Start for free” or “Get started” CTA and a secondary “Schedule demo / Contact sales” link. Some include a short security tagline (e.g., “Our AI is never trained on your data”).
Section order priorities: 1) hero with tagline and CTAs; 2) feature/benefits section detailing AI note‑taking, summaries, action items and integrations; 3) integration/support row showing logos of video platforms and CRM tools; 4) security/trust bar with compliance badges and ratings; 5) use‑case or solutions grid for different teams (e.g., sales, marketing); 6) pricing table or plans summary; 7) testimonials or quotes; 8) final CTA encouraging sign‑up or demo.
Proof emphasis: SaaS products emphasise product features and data privacy. Trust signals include SOC‑2/HIPAA badges and high user ratings. Logos of well‑known customers and compliance badges often substitute for case studies. Quantified metrics (e.g., 95 % accuracy, “Loved by 100k+ teams”) appear in some products.
Pricing presence: Visible pricing is standard. Sites typically offer 2–4 tiered plans (Free, Pro/Team, Business, Enterprise) with monthly/annual toggle and a free tier. Enterprise plans require contacting sales; deeper admin controls should be modular rather than hard‑coded.
Content objects needed: Feature/benefit cards, integration icons row, security/trust bar, pricing table with toggles, testimonial/ratings strip, use‑case cards and sign‑up/demo forms.
Home 3 – AI Trainers / Consultants
Hero pattern: Training sites position themselves as partners for AI adoption. They emphasise executive bootcamps, corporate workshops and customised curricula (e.g., Elevate AI highlights saving 10+ hours per week and multilingual support). The primary CTA invites visitors to “Join the bootcamp”, “Register now” or “Book a consultation”; secondary CTAs often include “Learn more” or “Contact sales”.
Section order priorities: 1) hero with promise and CTA; 2) programme overview describing corporate bootcamps, individual workshops and role‑specific tracks; 3) benefits/outcomes (hours saved, ROI within 30–90 days); 4) detailed curricula or course modules; 5) instructor or founder bios emphasising certifications and teaching roles; 6) testimonials or success metrics; 7) CTA band to enquire about training; 8) optional pricing/subscription table for self‑paced plans.
Proof emphasis: Credibility comes from instructor biographies, certifications, corporate clients and measured learner outcomes (e.g., “3 M learners”, completion rates 7× industry benchmark, 4.7+ rating). Providers often highlight proprietary frameworks (AI Strategy Canvas, prompt libraries) and emphasise hands‑on practice and ethical AI.
Pricing presence: Mixed. Some platforms publish subscription pricing (e.g., Learn Prompting lists Free, Plus, Teams and Enterprise plans), whereas many executive training programmes require a custom quote or consultation. Transparent pricing should therefore be optional.
Content objects needed: Programme/course cards, curriculum modules with durations, instructor bios, industry/role‑specific tracks, frameworks or downloadable tools, proof metrics, testimonials and contact/booking forms.
D) Enterprise‑only patterns to avoid
Complex mega‑menus and multi‑level navigation: Avoid the deep drop‑downs used by large consultancies and government contractors (e.g., Marlabs or Booz Allen). Keep navigation simple and prioritise the essentials.
Heavy compliance/security messaging: Extensive Responsible‑AI or Secure‑AI sections (as seen on Booz Allen’s site) are unnecessary for a small agency template. Include compliance badges only when relevant.
Region selectors and multi‑language toggles: Optional. Large enterprises often provide region/language selectors; small agencies and SaaS products can omit them.
Large insight libraries and career portals: Agencies like Marlabs and Booz Allen host vast resource hubs and career sections. For a premium theme, provide a simple blog/resource area instead.
Deep security documentation and admin controls: SaaS sites often link to full trust centres or advanced SSO/user‑management pages. These should be accessible via external links rather than built into the home template.
Excessive plan tiers: Micro‑SaaS products may offer many enterprise‑only features; the theme should support 2–4 plans and avoid rigid structures.
Large LMS integrations or multi‑lingual training frameworks: Training providers may integrate with SSO, LMS or provide analytics. Such enterprise integrations should be optional modules rather than core elements.
E) Template translation (component inventory)
Global components (used across all homes)
Header/Navigation: Responsive header with logo, primary navigation links and a prominent CTA button (contact, sign‑up or book consultation). Supports simple dropdowns but avoids complex mega‑menus.
Hero variants: Multiple hero templates with headline, subcopy, optional background graphic/image and up to two CTA buttons (primary and secondary).
Services/Features cards: A flexible grid to showcase 3–5 items. For agencies this lists services/capabilities; for SaaS it lists features; for trainers it lists programmes/tracks.
Proof/Trust strip: Horizontal bar or grid to display logos, badges, metrics or ratings. Configurable to show client logos, compliance badges, learner counts or award icons..
Testimonial slider: Carousel or card slider for quotes from clients or learners.
CTA band: Full‑width section with compelling text and a strong call‑to‑action (book consultation, sign up for free, join bootcamp). Can include a background colour or subtle pattern.
Lead‑capture forms: Modular contact or sign‑up form integrated with Calendly or email marketing tools. Configurable fields (name, email, message, optional scheduler).
Blog/Insights teaser: Optional module to display recent articles or resources with image, title and excerpt.
Footer: Standard footer with navigation links, contact information, social icons and legal text.
Home‑specific components
H1‑only (Agency):
Process/Methodology stepper: Visual timeline showing the agency’s approach (e.g., Discover → Advise → Deliver → Manage).
Case study cards: Grid or slider summarising success stories with headline, outcome metrics and link to detailed case study.
Service lifecycle band: A band to explain end‑to‑end services, similar to Ashling’s categories (Discover, Advise, Deliver, Manage, Evolve).
H2‑only (Micro‑SaaS):
Feature/Benefit stacks: Rows or cards highlighting product features such as transcription, summarisation, action items and integrations.
Integration icons row: A strip of icons/logos showing supported meeting platforms and CRM tools (Zoom, Teams, Salesforce, Slack etc.).
Security/Trust bar: Narrow bar featuring SOC‑2/HIPAA/GDPR badges and user ratings.
Pricing table: Responsive table accommodating 2–4 plans with monthly/annual toggle and plan features. Should allow hiding pricing for enterprise tiers.
Use‑case grid: Cards for personas or team‑specific solutions (Sales, Marketing, HR) showing tailored benefits.
H3‑only (Trainers/Consultants):
Programme/course cards: Cards listing bootcamps, workshops and curricula with duration, target audience and key outcomes.
Curriculum/module timeline: A sequence or tabbed layout to display course modules or workshop agendas.
Instructor/mentor bios: Profiles with photos, credentials and expertise.
Role/industry track selector: Interactive component letting users choose a role (e.g., marketing, HR, technical) and view tailored content.
Framework/Toolkit download: Section promoting proprietary frameworks (e.g., AI Strategy Canvas) or prompt libraries.
Subscription/pricing modules: For platforms offering self‑paced learning (e.g., Learn Prompting), provide cards or tables for Free, Plus, Team and Enterprise plans.
Required CPTs / taxonomies
Only create custom post types if the content will be reused across multiple pages. Recommended CPTs include Case Studies (agency), Programmes/Courses (trainers) and Resources/Blog Posts (all homes). Pricing plans and features can be stored as flexible repeater fields instead of separate CPTs. Taxonomies can classify programmes by role/industry and case studies by service type. SaaS feature lists can be implemented via custom fields or ACF repeater fields rather than requiring a CPT.
This synthesis ensures that the three homepages share a unified design system while highlighting the distinct needs of an AI agency, a SaaS product and an AI training provider. The patterns and components above derive solely from verifiable observations in the REAL research files.
